Early development prototype of a component system like Kompics in the Rust language, with performance and static typing in mind. It merges both Kompics' component model and the actor model as found in Erlang or Akka.

## Version

Requires Rust `nightly` right now until `try_from` and `specialization` features are stabilised.
